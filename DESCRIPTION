Description: This function implements a vector partition algorithm with
    global initialization that maximizes the modilarity measure and provide
    membership for community assignment. The idea is that the uncontrained
    solution of community assignment is the eigenvectors of the modualrity
    matrix. We project graph distance matrix to the eigenvectos in order to get a constrained solution and furture tune current assignment with
    one-iteration of k-means clustering or set it as an initialization of
    a full iteration of k-means clustering.
